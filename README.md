# Unsplash Api

## Description

Simple app to fetch and display queried photos or collections using unsplash api.

In order to retrieve your own access and secret keys, you will need to create a developer account [here](https://unsplash.com/documentation), but I'm leaving the ones I got for demonstration purposes. Be aware there's a rate limit.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
